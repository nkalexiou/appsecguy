It's almost time to board the plane and head to Las Vegas and attend the two most famous cybersecurity conferences in the world. I though I'd drop a few lines to capture my thoughts before the conferences begin. 

## Black hat

Agentic AI and AI/LLM security is everywhere. I don't think I've see a single product presentation not mentioning AI capabilities in some way, while there are several presentations on LLM exploitation, AI secure architecture and more. There are startup companies offering AI SOC analysts, AI AppSec architects and it just seems that this year as well, will be dominated by AI discussions. Not entirely unexpected I must say.. What drew my attention though is companies that are offering identity management, access control and governance of AI, which shows how this field seems to be evolving in an uncontrolled way for each company. 

I am looking forward to James Kettle's talk "HTTP/1.1 Must Die! The Desync Endgame" and also, Nicole Perloth's keynote. The app is really neat and helps organize your experience, altough it feels a bit outdated. 

## Defcon

This is really a "dream come true" for me and I think that for a good few hours I will be wandering around like a child in a candy shop.. When reality hits me, I will for sure attend both the social engineering village and the AppSec village that have amazing things planned. I believe the social engineering village will be integrating AI assistants to help hacking and I'm sure that the results will be great.
