Summer HackerCamp is over for 2025 and the experience was unique. A few keynotes, vendor meetings, hacking villages and more than 30 hours of travel time later, I can confidently announce that it was all worth it. Being based in Europe, there is nothing similar that I have experienced, which brings so many cybersecurity enthusiasts from around the world at one place, to learn, connect and advance the field. 

The organization, given the size of both conferences was near perfect and any inconveniences due to long queues or similar, was mainly due to conference center and room limitations. The presentations at both conferences, at least the ones I attended, were brilliant. I attended presentations of researchers hacking Apple CarPlay, Cursor, Microsoft Copilot and all sorts of AI agents and assistants, while I experienced truly inspiring keynote talks by Mikko Hypp√∂nen and Nicole Perlroth. I was especially inspired by Perlroth's keynote who bridged geopolitics, national security and actual real life with the work being done in Cybersecurity over the last decades, using unguided, direct and engaging storytelling.

DEFCON simply exceeded my expectations for a few key reasons:
- the people, the culture, the attitude
- the number of insanely well driven villages
- the actual potential to see and learn new techniques and engage with fellow hackers

I am still in the process of trying to put my notes and thoughts in order, because the overall experience and information received is overwhelming. However, if I could highlight a few key points from this year's conferences would be the following: 
- AI cannot solve everything, it will probably not cost much less when done properly. It needs AppSec, proper architecture, specific context and a lot of penetration testing. 
- Prompt injection is a real threat and something you have to account for if you are building generative AI systems. But it's not the only threat to consider. Trying to contain a prompt for security is hard, so keep in mind that as with all the things in security, every input is a potential attack vector. 
- Expose yourself, share your ideas and engage with people. Ask for opinions and look at what others do.

Looking forward to the next Hacker SummerCamp, whenever that may be.
